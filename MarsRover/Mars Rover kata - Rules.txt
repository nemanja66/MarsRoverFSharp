* You are given the initial starting point (1,1,N) of a rover.
* 1,1 are X,Y co-ordinates on a grid of (10,10).
* N is the direction it is facing (i.e. N,S,E,W).
* L and R allow the rover to rotate left and right.
* M allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.
* The rover receives a character array of commands e.g. RMMLM and returns the finishing point
after the move e.g. 2:1:N.
* Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another (planets are spheres after all).
* The grid may have obstacles. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point, 
aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle e.g. (O:2:2:N).
